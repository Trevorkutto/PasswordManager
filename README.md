# PasswordManager
A simple password manager i made so that generation of passwords and storage of such passwords is easy

This application stores information such as website, email/username and password into a local json called data.json.
User can choose to input preferred password or request the application to create one.
The randomly created password will be auto-saved to clipboard.


In addition, user may also search previously saved password and change the json data file. 

i made this using python on pycharm IDE
